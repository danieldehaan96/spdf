A respository with both industrial and simulated datasets on spare part demand forecasting, with the intention of benchmarking several intermittent demand forecasting methods on them.

This repository will contain R-code snippets, links to R-code and packages used and the data sets used in my master thesis.
The subject of the thesis is: Benchmarking spare part demand forecasting methods.
